The adventurer's journeyed to explore the Heath of Ezekiel where they met a fleeing Bánhelm soldier, he told them the Bordrand Keep was in trouble, he's going to request reinforcements but it seemed he had his doubts. They went to Borand Keep, a large human castle overlooking part of the south eastern Heath. They saw dead men in piles in front of the castle walls. They followed the directions the soldiers told them to find the barbarians who've layed the castle under siege. When they entered they were surprised to see that the place was pretty tidy, they easily slew the surprised bandits and kicked one wounded out to the wild with nothing but his hands to cover his crotch. Eventually they entered a room with a wide pit where they fought Argorn Grierliss, the brother of Fordon Grierliss, leader of the Aldorwyns. Vidar got dragged down after shoving the plated warrior down the abyss but grabbed the edge just in time. Fordon fell to his death and was left there to rot. They left then journeyed to the west in hopes of finding some ruins and magical wonders. They found a merry band of traders who offered in such a friendly manor to buy some magic items off of them. They took out a scroll and decided they would just take what they wanted. Casting a massive ball of fire from a scroll, the party was immediately knocked out, Makanar awoke first and managed to heal his crispy friends, and they all rose, seeking vengance. They chased after the bandits and slew each one of them, one rode his horse after death leading a massive trail of blood behind him. They found the horse dead in a crater off the side of a cliff. Upon investigating they found the horse had created a cave in that lead into an ancient dungeon. They explored and found it seemed to be housing folk devoted to the cult of Drōnach. Bediglian detected undead creatures with his magic and they moved on treading carefully. They fought some flying flaming skulls and Bediglian bagged on of them in his bag of holding. They entered a trapped room lined with gargoyles that started flooding once they turned some capstans by the walls. Vidar had the idea to throw the bag down and soak in all the water, sparing them precious time. They eventually stopped the flow by turning the capstans more and left, soaked and afraid, but alive. They then met in a room guarded by two skeletons, a hooded undead skeleton with a charred black staff atop a throne. In front of him was a huge skeleton towering at about 15ft tall. They fought to the death, Nenenu was flinged against the wall, Bediglian, Vidar and Makanar where wounded and bleeding on their last breaths, when they finally delivered the final blows to the mage. They took their plunders and returned to Wraithward, all just barely in one piece.
