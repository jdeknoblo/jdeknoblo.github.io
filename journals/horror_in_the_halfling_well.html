	Acht, Vidar, Nenenu, and Makanar traveled eastward to Browry End in the Flemberden. On the way they met some evil bandits which were promptly slaughtered, mostly by the hand of the vicious saytr bard Nenenu and Vidar who ruthlessly beheaded the scum. The rest of the travel to Browry end was peaceful and the party arrived at the well in Browry. They came down into the deep cave and found the dead body of the halfling that came down days before and were attacked by a big fleshy eyeball with an array of eyestalks coming out of it. Vidar stabbed it in the eyehole and they continued down the cave until Makanar slipped down a violent stream into a deep pool. The rest of the blinded party fell down into the pool after him, but him being the only one with darkvision had to guide them out while they were being feasted on by a swarm of hungry quippers. They safely got out but  Vidar nearly died. The pool seemed to have been the end of many other unwilling creatures as there was several bones scattered around it. They shuffled down the path and took a break before investigating a stairwell kept out of the water by a small stone dam. They went down the stairs following a mysterios clinking sound where they found 3 dark elves and two malnourished human slaves chipping at stone on the wall. Once they were seen the drow quickly executed one of them and the fight began. In the middle of the bloodshed the slave kept digging until it hit a stream of water which burst through violently and killed him instantly. The water flooded the room and the fight continued as the remaining drow were chased by the adventurers up a stairwell. One got axed in the head and the other tried to german suplex acht 60 feet off the stairwell but Acht luckily turned the tide and brutally smashed the drows skull against the stairs, smashing his brains into a pulp. They left the cave with their loot and got their money for the job, then returned to the adventurer's guild in wraithward
