    Adventurers: Bediglian Unful,  Gregarius Venquinel, Revalor Venquinel, Makanar de-Kulmyr
	<br />
Immediately after losing Nenenu, Makanar took Bediglian to go do a favor that they had been waiting a long time to make up for; finding Zabritham’s claim of his finely crafted Crimson Blood Armor. They met two elves who decided to join the Adventurer’s Guild, Gregarius and Revalor. Makanar, being his naturally curious and friendly self, decides to get to know one of the new party members, choosing Gregarius first. Gregarius, not trusting anyone, takes this act of kindness as an act of deceit, taking note. Later that day, Makanar would be haunted by the memory of watching his brother burn. Not knowing any better, Makanar went to try to save his brother, almost running and stumbling into the campfire. Gregarius, being the dick that he is, immediately tried to pry Makanar’s facade of strength and joy, enraging Makanar to the point where an inter-party brawl broke out in the snowy night. Makanar and Bediglian defeating the elves, and the lion taking Gregarius’ cloak and burning it, and bending his sacred mask and throwing it into the fire, but not killing Gregarius. The lion healed Revalor and told him what had occurred and left the two elves to rest and take watch. The party set forth to the location of where the armor was rumored to be last seen. After fighting their way deep into a cave, they found nothing but a portal and a bag of cursed magic items, Makanar and Bediglian realizing the armor was in the hands of the Drow of the Dwemereth Mountains.
