			<b>King Beodill IV</b> - The well respected and proud ruler of the Bánhelm Empire. Rules from a massive tower in the center of Wraithward and has complete and utter control of the empire. He's rarely seen out of his castle, and never without a entourage of guards at his side. 
			<br /><br />
			<b>Adventurer's Guild</b> - Where adventurer's gather to go on quests in Wraithward. The guild is ran by the a old dwarf named Zütthan Edemstoder. He's said to be over 300 years old but doesn't share much of his past. He has a long, badass scar going down his face and a long white beard. He wears a black helmet with matching plate and a onyx belt buckle. His partner, Roland Brooker, wears a pointy helmet over chainmail and a white surcoat with a symbol of Ezekiel. He's a tall, 30ish-year-old human with a bushy mustache and olive, wrinkled skin. The adventurer's guild is seen as a sort of joke by the town of Wraithward. People are not too fond of "adventuring" as straying far from civilization is extremely dangerous. Keeping members is also an issue because of this. But exploring is their passion and they've been keeping it up for years.

			<b>The Cathedral of Ailduil</b> - The only church in Wraithward is a big cathedral north of Beodill's quarters. It has a huge influence over the town of Wraithward, and even the Bánhelm Empire. Town guards and soldiers wear symbols of castle ramparts on top of a yellow sun, the symbol of Ailduil. The head preist is named Benedict Aubur and is a lanky man with short white hair and a long wrinkled face. He wears yellow and white robes and speaks in a monotone but tactful manor, though he seems to always have an annoyed demeanor.
