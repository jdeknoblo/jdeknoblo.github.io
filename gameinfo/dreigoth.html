  	The world is known by a few things by it’s many inhabitants. The dwarves of the Dwemereth Mountains know it as Dreigoth (which is it’s basically the common name as it’s called that by most civilizations) Elves call it Zemia in both Elvish and common toungue. The world is widely accepted to be a sphere but some of the less developed societies still think it’s flat. Travelling on the ocean is usually avoided as it’s expensive and dangerouns but there’s rumors and myths of islands far from Dreigoth with strange and dangerous inhabitants.

      Legend is that the world was created by the God of Blood, Drōnach, and the God of Light Ailduiel. Both are the complete opposite in nature and created the polarized Dreigoth. Because of this, the world can never have peace and Dreigoth is in a constant battle between good and evil, because the world was created by conflict, whether it be good or evil, or ugly or beautiful. In these trying times though, the world seems more to be filled with blood and darkness.
