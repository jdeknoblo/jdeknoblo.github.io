		<span style="text-align:center;text-decoration: underline;"><h1>Rules/Player Expectations</h1></span>
		<p style=" padding: 20px;">
		These are the rules/expectations and also my style as a GM (if you're a new player feel free ask me questions if you don't understand some things)
		</p>
		<p style="padding: 0px 20px 0px;">
		• <b>Fudging rolls</b> - I will be rolling in front of the players majority of the time. I prefer this because while I understand fudging rolls to make the experience better, but this campaign setting is supposed to be especially gritty.
		<br /><br />
		• <b>Racial stuff</b> - This doesn't mean races in D&D (I get that there's racial seggregation in-game e.g. Elves dislike dwarves, but I feel like that's a LOT different), I will not be allowing racist crap and slurs and all that for obvious reasons so I will not hesistate to kick you for that.
		<br /><br />
		• <b>Sexist stuff</b> - Basically the same for this as racism, it's very obviouslly wrong so rape and stuff like that is not allowed and you'll be kicked on my call.
		<br /><br />
		• <b>PvP</b>- I will highly discourage pvp even though I do allow evil alignments. I think that betrayal is interesting and would allow it if you're willing to give up <b>YOUR</b> character. Disputes should be handled in roleplay in terms of combat AND verbal tension (e.g. rolling for persuasion.)
		<br /><br />
		• <b>Attention</b> - It takes a good amount of time to prepare this stuff and doing something (e.g. playing a game) while were in the game is pretty annoying. I'll do my part to make the world as immersive as possible so you should do yours, or what's the point?
		<br /><br />
		• <b>Disruptions</b> - Another immersion breaking thing is blurting out or talking over me. There's really nothing worse as a player or GM when someones having an epic moment and some babbling idiot yells a shitty joke.  I hate feeling like a freaking teacher so if you're putting me in that situation time and time again, I'm kicking you.
		<br /><br />
		• <b>Rule Disputes</b> - This can really mess up the pace of the game, so if nobody knows the rule and it takes too long for me to find it, I'll just write down a note and check on it after the session and correct it later. I think following the rules is important but it's a game and having fun is a trillion times more important.
