		The adventurer's guild does make money from their plunders and exploits, but a key part of their income is information. This comes in the form mostly of history, geographical information, maps, info on people, monsters, and nature.
		<br />
		<br />
		Per quest players who take good notes and help build the wiki are awarded a decent sum of gold based on the quality and quantity of their notes. This gold is distributed throughout the entire party evenly and if every player takes good notes you can earn a hefty bag of gold indeed.
		<br />
		<br />
		The notes should be:
		<br />
		<br />
		• A journal of the adventure (key events)
		<br />
		• Descriptions of locations
		<br />
		• Loot the party got
		<br />
		• Monsters encountered
		<br />
		• People encountered
		<br />
		<br />
		The best way of doing this would probably be to split the notes up between players. One can do each and you can combine them at the end, split the loot, and then sell the info to the guild. This way fellow adventurers can see what happened on your quest, the party can get some extra gold, the known information of the Dreigoth can grow, and the guild can stay.
